## 🚀 Deployment Options

### Option 1: Docker Compose (Recommended)
```bash
# Quick deployment
./deploy.sh

# Manual deployment
docker-compose up --build -d
```

### Option 2: Manual Build
```bash
# Build the application
npm run build

# Serve with nginx
docker run -d -p 80:80 -v $(pwd)/dist:/usr/share/nginx/html nginx:alpine
```

### Option 3: Static Hosting
The `dist/` folder contains all static files ready for deployment to:
- Vercel
- Netlify
- AWS S3 + CloudFront
- GitHub Pages
- Any static hosting provider

## 🌐 Production URLs
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:5000
- **Grafana**: http://localhost:3001
- **RabbitMQ**: http://localhost:15672

## 🔒 Security Considerations
- [ ] Update JWT secrets in production
- [ ] Configure SSL certificates
- [ ] Set up proper CORS policies
- [ ] Enable rate limiting
- [ ] Configure firewall rules
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting

## 📊 Performance Metrics
- **First Contentful Paint**: Optimized
- **Largest Contentful Paint**: Optimized
- **Cumulative Layout Shift**: Minimized
- **Time to Interactive**: Optimized

## 🛠️ Environment Variables
Copy `production.env` to `.env` and update with your production values:
```bash
cp production.env .env
```

## 📝 Next Steps
1. **Deploy**: Run `./deploy.sh` to start the application
2. **Configure**: Update environment variables for production
3. **Monitor**: Set up monitoring and logging
4. **Scale**: Configure load balancing and scaling
5. **SSL**: Set up SSL certificates for HTTPS
